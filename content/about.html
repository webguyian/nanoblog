<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Congratulations! Somehow you've managed to stumble across my nanoblog.</p>
<p>My name is Ian Mac and I'm a front-end web developer on the East Coast. I've been passionate about the web since the first time I logged on with CompuServe and a dial-up modem. I created my very first websites with Yahoo! GeoCities in the late 90's and haven't stopped making websites since. I love both the design and development aspects of creating for the web so I'm fortunate that my job allows me to explore both (and get paid for it).</p>
<p>One of the most challenging parts I find about working in the web industry is having to keep up-to-date on the latest trends. Although I am a self-descibed lifelong learner, the rate at which this industry grows and technology changes can seem overwhelming at times. Thus, that is one of the reasons I've created this site. My mission is to collect, compile, and comment on the goings-on in the web industry. I don't know if that's too broad a topic or too narrow, but I'm up for the challenge.</p>
<p>I have dubbed this site a <em>nanoblog</em> for two reasons: 1) It was created with the lovely <a href="http://nanoc.ws/" target="_blank" title="nanoc">nanoc static site generator</a> and 2) I'll be adding <em>nano</em>-sized bits of commentary to the links I post. Call it a linklog, call it a <a href="http://daringfireball.net" target="_blank" title="Daring Fireball">Daring Fireball</a> knockoff, call it whatever you want. But I'm calling it my nanoblog.</p>
